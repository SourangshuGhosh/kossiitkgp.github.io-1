# Kharagpur Open Source Website

Welcome to the source code of the official website of KOSS!

## How does it work?

The website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an amazing static site generator written in Go. The theme used is hosted at [kossiitkgp/koss-hugo-theme](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/koss-hugo-theme).

This website has two submodules:
 - [content/blog](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/blog)
 - [content/docs](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/docs)

 The submodules contain all the content for the indexes `/blog/` and `/docs/`.

## How to update the website?

To update anything at `/blog/`, go to https://github.com/kossiitkgp/blog

To update anything at `/docs/`, go to https://github.com/kossiitkgp/docs
